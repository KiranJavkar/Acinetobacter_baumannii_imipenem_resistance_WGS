# Supplementary Data: Whole-Genome Assessment of Clinical *Acinetobacter baumannii* Isolates Uncovers Potentially Novel Factors Influencing Carbapenem Resistance

This repository contains the supplementary data and key results from our [published work](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.714284/full). We performed a whole genome analysis of *Acinetobacter baumannii* isolates, curated for carbapenem resistance phenotypes, to identify the known antimicrobial resistance factors within these genomes, assess the significance and association with the observed carbapenem-resistant phenotypes, and also uncover the potentially novel genomic factors influencing the carbapenem resistance.
